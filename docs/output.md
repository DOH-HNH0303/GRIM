# nf-core/grim: Output

## Introduction

This document describes the output produced by the pipeline. Most of the plots are taken from the MultiQC report, which summarises results at the end of the pipeline.

The directories listed below will be created in the results directory after the pipeline has finished. All paths are relative to the top-level results directory.

## Pipeline overview

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) and processes data using the following steps:

- [Phoenix AMR Locator](#phoenix-amr-locator) - Parse Phoenix AMR outputs and classify gene locations
- [MultiQC](#multiqc) - Aggregate report describing results and QC from the whole pipeline
- [Pipeline information](#pipeline-information) - Report metrics generated during the workflow execution

### Phoenix AMR Locator

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `phoenix_amr_locator/`
  - `*_gene_locations.tsv`: Main results file containing AMR gene locations (chromosomal vs plasmid)
  - `*_detailed_amr.tsv`: Detailed AMR analysis with comprehensive gene annotations

</details>

The Phoenix AMR Locator module processes existing Phoenix output files (GAMMA and AMRFinder results) to determine whether antimicrobial resistance genes are located on chromosomes or plasmids. It leverages Phoenix's pre-computed gene alignments and quality filtering to efficiently classify gene locations without redundant BLAST searches.

**Gene Locations File** (`*_gene_locations.tsv`) contains:
- Sample ID and gene information
- Location classification (chromosome, plasmid, or unknown)
- Contig details with names and lengths
- Quality metrics from Phoenix (percent identity and coverage)
- Source information (GAMMA or AMRFinder)
- Beta-lactam gene identification

**Detailed AMR File** (`*_detailed_amr.tsv`) contains:
- All information from gene locations file
- Additional metadata including gene categories and databases
- Point mutation information from AMRFinder
- Comprehensive annotations for research analysis

### MultiQC

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `multiqc/`
  - `multiqc_report.html`: a standalone HTML file that can be viewed in your web browser.
  - `multiqc_data/`: directory containing parsed statistics from the different tools used in the pipeline.
  - `multiqc_plots/`: directory containing static images from the report in various formats.

</details>

[MultiQC](http://multiqc.info) is a visualization tool that generates a single HTML report summarising all samples in your project. The pipeline QC results are visualised in the report and further statistics are available in the report data directory.

Results generated by MultiQC collate pipeline QC from the Phoenix AMR Locator analysis. The pipeline has special steps which also allow the software versions to be reported in the MultiQC output for future traceability. For more information about how to use MultiQC reports, see <http://multiqc.info>.

### Pipeline information

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `pipeline_info/`
  - Reports generated by Nextflow: `execution_report.html`, `execution_timeline.html`, `execution_trace.txt` and `pipeline_dag.dot`/`pipeline_dag.svg`.
  - Reports generated by the pipeline: `pipeline_report.html`, `pipeline_report.txt` and `software_versions.yml`. The `pipeline_report*` files will only be present if the `--email` / `--email_on_fail` parameter's are used when running the pipeline.
  - Reformatted samplesheet files used as input to the pipeline: `samplesheet.valid.csv`.
  - Parameters used by the pipeline run: `params.json`.

[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html) provides excellent functionality for generating various reports relevant to the running and execution of the pipeline. This will allow you to troubleshoot errors with the running of the pipeline, and also provide you with other information such as launch commands, run times and resource usage.
